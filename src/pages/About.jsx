Kjære [Arbeidsgiver],

Jeg skriver for å uttrykke min interesse for stillingen som Junior Frontend Developer hos dere. Med en sterk lidenskap for teknologi og en nylig fullført utdanning innen frontend-utvikling, mener jeg å ha de ferdighetene og motivasjonen som trengs for å kunne bidra verdifullt til deres team.

Jeg fullførte nylig en 12 ukers intensiv kurs innen frontend-utvikling, hvor jeg fikk praktisk erfaring med HTML, CSS, JavaScript og React. I tillegg til denne formelle utdanningen, har jeg også utviklet mine ferdigheter gjennom selvstudium og personlige prosjekter.

Jeg er en rask lærer og trives i et samarbeidsorientert miljø. Jeg er sikker på at min entusiasme for teknologi og min vilje til å konstant forbedre meg vil gjøre meg til en verdifull ressurs for deres team.

Takk for at dere vurderer min søknad. Jeg gleder meg til å få muligheten til å diskutere mine kvalifikasjoner ytterligere og hvordan jeg kan bidra til suksessen til deres selskap.

Med vennlig hilsen
*/
